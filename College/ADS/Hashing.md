* Get a large array 
* Design a hash function h which converts keys into array indices .
* Insert (key, value) in the array at h(key) position.
* Can also be used in external memory (addresses instead of array indices)


Good hash function
- Minimize collisions
- Easy and quick to compute
- Distribute key values evenly in the hash table
- Use all the information provided in the key

Static Hashing
