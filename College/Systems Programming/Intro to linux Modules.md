**In the Linux kernel, modules are pieces of code that can be dynamically loaded and unloaded into the kernel at runtime. This provides several key advantages:**


Common types of kernel modules include:

**Device drivers**: These modules provide support for interacting with hardware devices, such as network cards, graphics cards, storage devices, and more.
**File systems**: Modules can implement different file system types, allowing the kernel to access and manage data stored on various storage devices.
**System calls**: Modules can add new system calls, expanding the kernel's functionality and providing new ways for user-space programs to interact with the kernel.
