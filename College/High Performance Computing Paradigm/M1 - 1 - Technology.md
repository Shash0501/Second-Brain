History of processor performance

### Parallelism in application

**Data level parallelism**
Operation on data can be done in parallel.

**Task level Parallelism**
Multiple tasks can be created
All work independently and in parallel


Architectural Parallelism

Instruction Level Parallelism
- Multiple instructions could eb executed in parallel
- Pipeline exploits ILP
- Exploits data level parallelism with compiler help

Thread Level Parallelism
- Exploit both data level and task level parallelisms
- Tightly couple hardware
