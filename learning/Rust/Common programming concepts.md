## Shadowing

We can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable.

Basically the first variable is shadowed by the second which means that the second variable is what the compiler will see when you use the name of the variable.

shadowing allows us to change a variable's type but mut doesn't allow that. It just allows us to change the value and not the type

Rust has tow data types Scalar and Compound

Scalar types represent a single value.
Rust has 4 - integers, floating, booleans and characters
